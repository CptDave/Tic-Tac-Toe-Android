    <string name="about_description">
        Originally written in C++ as a very rough and incomplete command-line tic tac toe program,
        Later was copied over to android studios and changed to an android app.\n\n

        The C++ version was first started in November - December of 2014. Today is almost 2 years
        later on October 2nd 2016. This Tic-Tac-Toe project has seen many improvements and changes
        and now I am finally at a point where i can soundly say this app is ready for public
        release, marked version 1.0.
